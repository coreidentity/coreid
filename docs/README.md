* The basic concept here is that people have more than one legitimate "identity" in each importat context of their lives.  Below is a simple image from a 2002 "think piece" on common sense public policy and legal frameworks for identity management technology.  The technology available at that time did not provide a workable method for individuals to have and use context-based identities that are primarily owned and controlled by others (eg government, hospitals, merchants, employers, etc) while maintaining a usable "core identity" of their own. Today, however, it is possible that the "address" used by individual users of the Bitcoin and Ethereum public blockchains can provide a technical method enabling "core identity" of this type.  This CoreID.me open source project is exploring this potential through rapid prototype, convening stakeholders to evaluate/discuss and conducting a series of business, legal and technical assessment tests to start preliminary measure of the suitability of this approach to meet key requirements and other performance metrics.
